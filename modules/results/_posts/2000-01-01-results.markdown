#Results

You can customize test steps as pass or fail status using the Reporter Object. 

Syntax:

Reporter.ReportEvent EventStatus, ReportStepName, Details [, ImageFilePath]

EventStatus can be one of the following:
----------------------------------------------------
- 0 or micPass  sends a pass status to test result window
- 1 or micFail sends a fail status to test result window
- 2 or micDone sends a message to test result window without affecting the Pass/Fail status
- 3 or micWarning sends a warning message to the result window

Ex:
Reporter.ReportEvent micPass, "Login", "The Flight application was logged into successfully."
