#Checkpoints

Checkpoints are a validation point that is used to compare the current value of specified properties with the expected value. It's a good way to double check that your script is getting or doing the right thing. 

There are several different kinds of checkpoints:
-----------------------------------------------------------
-Standard Checkpoint (Objects)

-Bitmap Checkpoint

-File Content Checkpoint

-Table Checkpoint

-Text Checkpoint

-Text Area Checkpoint

-Accessibility Checkpoint

-Page Checkpoint

-Database Checkpoint

-XML Checkpoint

For our example we are going to use a standard checkpoint which just checks the current object's propterty/value pairs with the expected property/value pairs. We are going to use our checkpoint to make sure the login window for Flight is open. So have the login in window open for Flight, click Record on QTP and then click on Insert -> Checkpoint -> Standard Object.

Once you do that, your mouse will be a pointer so that whatever you next click on will be the object it chooses for the checkpoint. I clikced on the login window.

Make sure if got the element you wanted and then click ok.

This then shows you the captured property/value pairs it will use as the expected values that it will compare against runtime values. 

It then adds a line of code to your test script:

But we need to modify it a bit. Let's say your test runs and that login box is not there. The script will just error out. Let's put in an if/else statement so that we can control what happens when the checkpoint passes and when the checkpoint fails.
