title: Object Models
---

There are various Object Models that help VBScript interact with a certain group of objects. This can be exetremely useful in your test scripts.


#COM - Component Object Model

COM is used to help interact with Microsoft objects. COM  objects includes Microsoft technologies like: OLE, OLE Automation, ActiveX, COM+, DCOM, the Windows shell, DirectX, and Windows Runtime. COM helps us interact with Microsoft Objects like Word, Access, Excel, Outlook, Internet Explorer, and the Windows File System Object.

First we must create an instance of the object we want to use:

#WSH - Windows Script Host Object Model

You can use WSH to run applications, manipulate the contents of the registry, or send keyboard input.

#DOM - Document Object Model
You can use DOM to interact with objects in HTML, XHTML, and XML documents. So think web applications. 

#AOM - Automation Object Model

You can use AOM to load all the required add-ins for a test, make QTP visible while execution, opens the test using the specified location, associates function libraries, setting the common object sync time out, start and end iteration, enable/disable smart identification, on error settings, data table path, recovery scenario settings, and log tracking settings. So you can use AOM objects to help automate configurations for your test script.
