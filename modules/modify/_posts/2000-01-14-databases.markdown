#Databases

You can use QTP to interact with databases using ADODB or the Active X Database Object model. This way you can interact with SQLServer, MySQL, Oracle, Excel, Access, and Sybase.

There are four methods that we need to use when interacting with databases:

ADODB.Connection - Connects you to a database

ADODB.Command - Executes  SQL commands, queries, or stored procedures

ADODB.Fields - get a specific column from a record set after executing a query or stored procedure

ADODB.Recordset - get data from a database
