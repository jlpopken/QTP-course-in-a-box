#Import/Export DataTables

We are going to learn how to put values for our tests on a spreadsheet and then import that spreadsheet as the Global DataTable so that QTP can read in those values instead of using hardcoded values in the test script itself. 

1. Open up an excel spreadsheet
2. First write the header for the column and then put in the value
    Ex. Here you see a "USER" column with a value "jeanette"
