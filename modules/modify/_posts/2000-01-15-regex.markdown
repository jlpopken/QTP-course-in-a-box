#Regular Expressions

In computer science, regular expressions are used to define a search pattern. Using a search pattern we can validate that a string matches our pattern or we can use our pattern to perform find and replace operations. 

In this example we will use Regular Expressions to find and replace the world "lamb" with "puppy" in a string.
