#If/Else

We can also use If/Else logic to only do something with our script if it does or doesn't meet a certain condition. In this example, we will use price. If the price is below $400 we will write to a new column that it is a low price. Or else, if the price is above $400 we will write that it is a high price. 

Our code will look like this:
