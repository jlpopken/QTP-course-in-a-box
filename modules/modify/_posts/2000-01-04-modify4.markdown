#Loops

Often times in scripts, we will want to repeat or loop through something so we can do this multiple times. In this case we are going to add a loop into our script so that it creates more than one order. 

First we will need to record a few more steps in our Flight application. After we insert the order, we will need to record clicking on the "new order" button.
