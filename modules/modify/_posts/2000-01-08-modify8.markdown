#Recovery Scenarios

As your test scripts run, they will some times run into unexpected problems or errors. We will use recovery scenarios so that our scripts can "recover" from these errors and continue running the script. 

Click on Resources -> Recovery Scenario Manager

For this example, we will be putting in yesterday's date and this will cause a pop-up window stating that this is an incorrect date. So we want to select the pop-up window event at our trigger.
