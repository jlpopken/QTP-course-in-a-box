I will be using QTP version 11 in all my videos and screenshots. If you are using UFT or an older version of QTP there may be some slight variances. 

When you open up QTP you will get a prompt asking which addins to load:

Basically, you only want to pick the addins that you absolutely need for your test or else it will bloat your test. So if you are testing a web application select the web addin. If you are testing SAP GUI then select the SAP addin. 

QTP/UFT comes with a sample application called "Flight" that you can play around with as a type of sandbox. We will be using Flight for our lab. Click on your start menu -> HP Quicktest Profession -> Sample Application -> Flight.

When you try to open the sample application it will prompt you for a username and password.

Type in your name for the username (but it can really be anything that is at least 4 characters in length).
The password is "mercury."

Flight is an application where you can book a flight between two cities for a certain date via an order. You can modify or delete the order. You can fax a customer your signature. It even has a reports and graphs area. So it will be a great start to understand QTP and its potential.
