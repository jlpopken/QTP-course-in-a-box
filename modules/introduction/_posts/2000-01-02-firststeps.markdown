#First Steps

FYI - I will be completing this course using QTP version 11. If you are using UFT or an older version of QTP there may be some slight variances. 

When you open up QTP you will get a prompt asking which addins to load.

Basically, you only want to pick the addins that you absolutely need for your test or else it will bloat your test.
