#First Steps

FYI - I will be completing this course using QTP version 11. If you are using UFT or an older version of QTP there may be some slight variances. 

When you open up QTP you will get a prompt asking which addins to load:

Basically, you only want to pick the addins that you absolutely need for your test or else it will bloat your test. 

QTP/UFT comes with a sample application called "Flight" that you can play around with as a type of sandbox. We will be using Flight for our lab. Click on your start menu -> HP Quicktest Profession -> Sample Application -> Flight.
