#The Development Request

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's say a customer comes to IT development with a request for some brand new software. For the purposes of this course, we will say the request is a new calculator web application. This course will focus on the process IT follows to deliver this new software.

The customer details the functionality of the calculator by stating it must be able to do all the basic things like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. It also requests a button be added that would calculate a custom percentage.

The customer also filled out a specification form detailing the requested application.
