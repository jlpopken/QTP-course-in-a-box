Application Name: Finance Calculator

Business Owner: Frank Smith

Priority: low

Desired Functionality: The calculator must be able to add, subtract, muliple, divide, and raise numbers to a power. It must also have a custom percentage function so instead of getting the percentage out of 100 it gets the percentage for out of 75.  Example: if the input is 51 then the custom percentage should return 68% ((51 / 75) * 100).
