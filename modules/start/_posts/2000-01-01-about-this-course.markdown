#What will you need?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This lab is meant to be both training and a quick reference. The videos will walk you through the topic and the text/screenshots can be used as a quick cheat sheet. 

1. In order complete this lab, you will need access to QTP or UFT and it's sample application Flight.

2. I recommend you watch the videos fullscreen (in HD) and try to follow along as you can.

3. The goal of this lab is to help you understand how to script flexible, automated tests using QTP/UFT. 


**Doing this lab at your own pace does not mean that you have to do the course on your own. Invite a friend!**
