#What will you need?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.In order to complete the exercises, you will need access to QTP or UFT and it's sample application Flight.

2.I recommend you watch the videos (in HD) and try to follow along.

3.The goal of this lab is to help you understand how to script flexible, automated tests using QTP/UFT. 


**Doing the course at your own pace does not mean that you have to do the course on your own. Invite a friend!**
