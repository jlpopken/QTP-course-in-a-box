To record, just click on the record button at the top. Remember your record and run settings will have an effect on what happens. You can use those settings to open a window to record on or you can choose to record on an already open window. 

I highly encourage you to play around with the recording feature to get a better feel of object recognition. Try recording the flight application with different add ins. Do you see a difference between using Active X  versus .Net?
