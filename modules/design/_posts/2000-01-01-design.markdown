#Design

Design and user experience take the focus in this next step. How should this new development look? Is the process flow simple and intuitive? A good user experience leads to:

- better productivity
- better user satisfaction
- less training time and cost
- less errors
- less additional development requests

Going over a visual "mock up" of the proposed design is always a good idea. A picture is worth more than a thousand words.
The first mock up of the new calculator application looked like this:

But the customer decided it was confusing for the customer percent button to look like a normal percentage button so they had us change it to better highlight that it was a custom function.

This is just one simple example. In a real development situation IT and the customer would revise a design mock up several times before agreeing on it.
